# Sokoban with P5.js


I've watched some videos from Daniel Shiffman using P5.js to develop a several things.
I found an interesting lib.
Downloaded and tried to test doing something.
I searched some things and found this quiz on http://rubyquiz.com/quiz5.html.
This quiz is about a old puzzle game (Sokoban) that I used to play when I was young.
Found nice and try to make it for fun.
And there it is.
It's a little messy, I know.
Sorry.
):)

##### Things I've used:
* Use some features of ecma6
* P5.js lib
* NodeJs v6.6.0 used to load the txt levels

To try out:

```
    # npm install -g http-server
    $ http-server .
```

##### Modifying levels
All levels are in a txt `sokoban_levels.txt`, modify it then run `$ node bin/loadLevels` to update in game.
